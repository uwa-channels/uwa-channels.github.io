* Experiment:
  * Location: 22N, 159W
  * Date recorded: June 2011
  * Center frequency: 13 kHz
  * Bandwidth: 6.25 kHz
  * Symbol rate: R = 6.25 kHz
  * Distance: 3 km and 7 km
  * Tx/Rx/water depth [m]: 50/50/100
  * Mobility: static
  * Receiving array 1: vertical, 24 elements, 5 cm spacing (numbered top to bottom)
  * Receiving array 2: vertical, 24 elements, 20 cm spacing (numbered top to bottom)
* Parameters:
  * Sampling rate in delay: 2R
  * Total delay coverage: up to 20 ms
  * Sampling rate in time: R/<mark> [compression ratio] </mark> for the channel response, 2R for the phase/delay
  * Total time coverage: <mark> 12 s </mark>.

  <!-- * Maximum frequency of a baseband signal passing through the channel: not to exceed 4.89 kHz. -->
