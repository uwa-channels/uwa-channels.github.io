* Experiment:
  * Location: 40N, 70W
  * Date recorded: June 2010
  * Center frequency: 13 kHz
  * Bandwidth: 5 kHz
  * Symbol rate: R = 10^7/2048 Hz (approximately 4.8 kHz)
  * Distance: 3 km - 7 km
  * Tx/Rx/water depth [m]: 30-60/50/100
  * Mobility: varying, up to 1.5 m/s
  * Receiving array: vertical, 12 elements, 12 cm spacing (numbered top to bottom)
 

* Parameters:
  * Sampling rate in delay: 2R
  * Total delay coverage: up to 20 ms
  * Sampling rate in time: R/100 for the channel response, 2R for the phase/delay
  * Total time coverage: .

  <!-- * Maximum frequency of a baseband signal passing through the channel: not to exceed 4.89 kHz. -->
