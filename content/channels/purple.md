* Experiment:
  * Location: 41N, 70W
  * Date recorded: October 2008
  * Center frequency: 12.5 kHz
  * Bandwidth: 6.5 kHz
  * Symbol rate: R = 6.5 kHz
  * Distance: 60 m (array 1), 200 m (array 2), and 1 km (array 3)
  * Tx/Rx/water depth [m]: 11/10/15
  * Mobility: static
  * Receiving array 1: cross, 16 elements each leg, 5 cm spacing (numbered top to bottom), 
  * Receiving array 2: vertical, 16 elements, 5 cm spacing (numbered top to bottom)
  * Receiving array 3: vertical, 12 elements, 12 cm spacing (numbered top to bottom)
* Parameters:
  * Sampling rate in delay: 2R
  * Total delay coverage: up to 20 ms
  * Sampling rate in time: R/<mark> [compression ratio] </mark> for the channel response, 2R for the phase/delay
  * Total time coverage: <mark> 12 s </mark>.

  <!-- * Maximum frequency of a baseband signal passing through the channel: not to exceed 4.89 kHz. -->
