* Experiment:
  * Location: Off the coast of Kochi Prefecture
  * Date recorded: July 2022
  * Center frequency: 6 kHz
  * Bandwidth: 4 kHz
  * Symbol rate: R = 4 kHz
  * Distance: 14 km
  * Tx/Rx/water depth: 176 m/146 m/x. The data contain down-slop, up-slope and flat. The water depth in the flat scenario is 200 m.
  * Mobility: moored
  * Receiving array: vertical, up to 24 elements. There are six hydrophone groups. Within each group, the inter-element spacing is 0.9 m. The distance between groups is 1.8 m. 
* Parameters:
  * Sampling rate in delay: 2R
  * Total delay coverage: up to 117.5 ms
  * Sampling rate in time: R/100 for the channel response, 2R for the phase/delay
  * Total time coverage: 1 minute
